# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI agents (Claude, etc.) working on this repository.

## What this project is

**blue-merle-fork** — a fork of
[srlabs/blue-merle](https://github.com/srlabs/blue-merle), a privacy
tool for the GL-E750 Mudi 4G router. See [`README.md`](./README.md)
for the change list vs. upstream.

The repository, the package (opkg), and every on-device path all keep
the upstream name **blue-merle**. Do NOT rename `PKG_NAME` in the
Makefile without a full uninstall/reinstall on the target and a
matching rewrite of every path in the tree.

## Ground rules

- **Never push to `origin`** unless the user explicitly asks. All work
  lives on the `main` branch.
- **Never commit, amend, push, or create PRs unless the user explicitly asks.**
  Show diffs, propose commit messages; wait for the user to say "commit".
- **Never log or print full IMEI/IMSI values.** This is the tool's core
  purpose (see `README.md § 1. Anti-anonymity leaks fixed`). Use masked
  forms (`354567******1234`) for user-visible output.
- **`shred` is banned on this codebase.** It is theatrical on NAND flash
  (wear leveling) and pointless on tmpfs. Use `rm`, or better, mount tmpfs.
- **Do not add MAC generators without the U/L bit set unless the caller
  explicitly opts into an Apple OUI.** Free-form random MACs must be
  locally-administered (RFC 7844). Apple-OUI MACs are the exception,
  handled via `APPLE_MAC_GEN` only.

## Files that need caution

| File | Why it's sensitive |
|---|---|
| `files/lib/blue-merle/functions.sh` | Central helpers — MAC/hostname/SSID randomizers, IMEI readers. Every function used by init, CLI and toggle. |
| `files/usr/bin/blue-merle-switch-stage{1,2}` | Toggle-driven SIM swap. Runs without TTY. Split across two processes with tmpfs state. Timing-sensitive around `AT+CFUN=4` (asynchronous). |
| `files/usr/bin/blue-merle` | Interactive CLI. `flock`-serialized. Must not deadlock; every `until` must be bounded. |
| `files/lib/blue-merle/imei_generate.py` | Talks to modem over pyserial with `exclusive=True`. Careful with retry logic and validation regexes. |
| `Makefile` | `preinst`/`postinst` run on the actual Mudi. Bugs here = broken install. |
| `files/usr/share/rpcd/acl.d/luci-app-blue-merle.json` | LuCI ACL. Do not add wildcards. Every subcommand enumerated explicitly. |

## Target platform

- **Architecture:** `mips_24kc` (ath79/nand)
- **OpenWrt:** 23.05, busybox ash (not bash). Avoid `[[ ]]`, `==`,
  bash arrays. Test scripts with `sh -n`.
- **Modem:** Quectel EP06-E/A, controlled via AT commands over `/dev/ttyUSB3`
  (see `BLUE_MERLE_TTY` env override).
- **MCU:** 16x2 char display accessed via `/dev/ttyS0` JSON protocol.
- **Python:** 3.x from `python3-pyserial` package.

## Build

```sh
# See README.md §Build for the full sequence.
SDK=/tmp/opencode/bm-build/openwrt-sdk-23.05.0-ath79-nand_gcc-12.3.0_musl.Linux-x86_64
cd $SDK && make -j$(nproc) package/blue-merle/{clean,compile} V=s
# Result: bin/packages/mips_24kc/base/blue-merle_3.0.5-local-*.ipk
cp $SDK/bin/packages/mips_24kc/base/blue-merle_*.ipk ./dist/
```

## Test

```sh
python3 tests/run_all.py   # 44 tests; must all pass
```

If pytest is not available, `run_all.py` is a lightweight replacement.

## Common pitfalls

- **`__pycache__` leaking into ipk:** local test runs create bytecode in
  `files/lib/blue-merle/__pycache__/`. Makefile scrubs it at package time,
  but also `rm -rf` before `git add` to avoid the noise.
- **Modem TTY changes:** don't hardcode `/dev/ttyUSB3`. Discover dynamically.
- **`uci commit` matters:** setting `glconfig.general.macclone_addr` requires
  `uci commit glconfig`, not `uci commit network`.
- **`5 GHz interface may be disabled`** in the user's config: always use
  `uci -q … 2>/dev/null || true` when touching `wireless.@wifi-iface[1]`.
- **Interactive `read` in stage1/stage2:** these run without TTY. Never
  `read` there; use tmpfs state files instead.
- **Busybox lacks `od` on stock Mudi firmware.** This bit us once already:
  `od -An -N2 -tu2 /dev/urandom | tr -d ' '` returned empty, so every
  `$(( "" % N + 1 ))` in `_pick_random_line` evaluated to 1 and rotation
  always picked the first entry (`Aaron`, `iPhone-X`). Use
  `/proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid` — it is a kernel interface, needs no
  external tools, and yields a fresh 128-bit UUID per read. See
  `_rand16` in `functions.sh`.
- **`hexdump` is not always in busybox either.** Same principle as `od`:
  prefer the kernel-provided interfaces or `printf '%x' "$n"`.
- **Anything relying on `/dev/urandom` at boot on MIPS-without-hwrng:**
  the pool may be under-seeded during `START=10` init. `entropy_avail`
  can be as low as 128–256 in those seconds. `/proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid`
  will still produce output but its quality may be low. Not a blocker
  for privacy-related randomization, but a note for future audits.

## When exploring / auditing

- Use `python3 tests/run_all.py` as a smoke test after any change.
- `sh -n path/to/script` to verify POSIX syntax.
- `USAGE.md` and `USAGE_RU.md` document day-to-day commands; update
  if behavior changes.
